            In my projects you'll find an eclectic span of interests, but I've
            highlighted some of my personal favorites which I believe provide
            some novel utility to the world.

            <b>Claude Timeline</b>
          </a>
            <p>
              Claude Timeline is a great project management tool for Claude Code if you use Tmux. Timeline allows for functionality 
              not currently available in Claude Code: forking conversations, merging one conversation with the context compaction from another, 
              and easy naming and storage/retrieval of Claude Code sessions.

            <b>OPUS-OS</b>
          </a>
            <p>
              Opus-OS is an autopoietic (self-organizing) system that I built for my home Mac Mini server.
              My intent is for it to act as a seamless layer between you and your choice of AI assistant. Hopefully you'll find that
              it can be better than anything a model provider can provide you as it has full read and write access to Apple icloud so that it send you messages in iMessage,
              or maybe put in a calendar entry for you to see. It also has access to custom software 
              that you've built together or asked it to write by itself. In fact, being that it reflects about your interactions while not in use,
              it may surprise you with a useful or fun piece of software that it can share to you via any accessible published website 
              -- mine will share things with me through this website mkleyn.com infact.
              To me this is the future of how AI will work, not through a web portal where you keep all of your data accessible for enternity to some 3rd party,
              but secure in your local computer or personal server.

            My project w/
            <a href="https://faculty.sfsu.edu/~hetao/">Professor Tao He</a>
            at her lab in UCSF and SFSU. This project was made possible by
            funding given by the National Science Foundation's LEAPS award. The
            project aimed to explore various machine learning methods for
            predicting cell types using novel TCR data to expedite cancer
            diagnoses. During the project, I had the opportunity to train
            multiple statistical models using modern machine learning
            techniques.

            Friends Against S.A.D. is my electronic music project. One of the
            things that pushed me down a path of studying math and machine
            learning was music, especially electronic music. Friends Against SAD
            is where I get to write songs, experiment with digital audio
            processing tools that I've created and also as an excuse to have fun
            weekends DJing. I hope you enjoy the music :)

            ><b>Order Without Design Podcast by Devon Zuegel</b></a
          >
          <p>
            I followed Devon on twitter for a long time, and I remember one day
            she'd posted that she was looking for some help setting up her
            studios microphones. Given my background in audio I reached out to
            her. One thing led to another and I eventually ended up mixing and
            editing 4 episodes of the Order Without Design podcast.
            Unfortunately, I couldn't continue due to school however I did enjoy
            my time getting to work with Devon as well as listening to her
            fantastic conversations with Marie-Agnes and Alain Bertaud!
