            In my projects you'll find an eclectic span of interests, but I've
            highlighted some of my personal favorites which I believe provide
            some novel utility to the world.
          </p>

          <!-- <h3><b>Highlights</b></h3> -->
          <a href="https://github.com/michaelkleyn/CellTypePrediction"
            ><b>Novel Cell Type for Cancer Diagnosis Prediction</b></a
          >

            My project w/
            <a href="https://faculty.sfsu.edu/~hetao/">Professor Tao He</a>
            at her lab in UCSF and SFSU. This project was made possible by
            funding given by the National Science Foundation's LEAPS award. The
            project aimed to explore various machine learning methods for
            predicting cell types using novel TCR data to expedite cancer
            diagnoses. During the project, I had the opportunity to train
            multiple statistical models using modern machine learning
            techniques.

          <a><b>Conduits</b></a>
          <p>
            Conduits started as a question of how would I redesign a classroom
            which was integrated with LLM's. For me this has become a special
            tool that will help catch students when they begin to get behind,
            and keep them motivated to continue learning while keeping the
            teacher in the loop the entire time.
          </p>

          <a><b>ASCII-AI</b></a>
          <p>
            AI voices need a face, but AI faces currently are still too much in
            the uncanny valley. ASCII-AI provides an ASCII rendered face to your
            AI assistant.
          </p>
          <br />
          <a><b>MemDex</b></a>
          <p>
            MemDex is my way of combining LLM's and Anki to help my own working
            memory be the best it can be. Select any piece of text that you're
            reading and MemDex will create the Anki card for you.
