        <h1>Hi, my name is Michael.</h1>
        <p1>
          I'm a late entrant to the culture built by coders and hackers. For all
          my life, I'd only wanted to write and perform music. From age 6 to 26,
          that was all I knew. I was deeply enmeshed in the music industry and
          electronic music scene of California from 2010 until about 2017. The
          reality of that industry struck me hard in those later years, so I
          decided to explore other areas of life. I started studying part-time
          at a local community college, beginning with high school math. And
          now, in 2024, I've just graduated with a BS in Applied Mathematics.
        </p1>

          I currently live in San Francisco. And, thankfully, I feel that I've
          finally settled on a culture and career that I'll pursue for the rest
          of my days. I enjoy spending my free time investigating different
          modalities of human-computer interaction. Whether it's working on
          novel audio synthesizers or training ML models for better cancer
          diagnostics, I'm excited about the potential to extend and expand
          human possibilities as far as possible.
