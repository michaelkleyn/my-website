        <h1 class="">Hi, my name is Michael.</h1>
        <p class="fade-in-1">
          I'm a late entrant to the culture built by coders and hackers. For all
          my life, I'd only wanted to write and perform music. From age 6 to 26,
          that was all I knew. After highschool I moved from my rural hometown
          to enmesh myself in California's music industry. From 2010 until about
          2017 I toured, produced music with notable artists, cohabited a art
          collective warehouse in SF, and overall had a really good time. The
          reality of that industry struck me hard in those later years, so I
          decided to explore other areas of life. I started studying part-time
          at a local community college. And now, in 2024, I've just graduated
          with a BS in Applied Mathematics of Computer Science, an experience
          leaving me captivated by computers, and the new mathematics we can
          discover to improve them.

        <p class="fade-in-2">
          I currently live in San Francisco, and thankfully I feel that I've
          finally settled on a culture and career that I'll cherish for the rest
          of my days. Lately, I enjoy spending my free time investigating
          different modalities of human-computer interaction. Whether it's
          working on novel audio synthesizers or training ML models for better
          cancer diagnostics, I'm excited about the potential to extend and
          expand human possibilities as far as possible.
