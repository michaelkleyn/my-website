        <h1 class="">Hi, my name is Michael.</h1>
        <p class="fade-in-1">
          I currently live in San Francisco, where I enjoy spending my free time
          investigating different modalities of human-computer interaction.
          Whether it's working on novel audio synthesizers or training ML models
          for better cancer diagnostics, I'm excited about the potential to
          extend and expand human possibilities as far as possible.

          For all my life, I'd only wanted to write and perform music. From age
          6 to 26, that was my career path. After highschool I moved from my
          rural Washington hometown, South Bend, to enmesh myself in
          California's music industry. From 2010 until about 2017 I toured,
          produced music with notable artists, collaborated and cohabited in an
          art collective warehouse in SF, and mostly lived out my dreams. The
          reality of the insecurity of that industry struck me hard in those
          later years though, so I decided to explore other areas of life. I
          started studying part-time at a local community college. And now, in
          2024, I've just graduated with a BS in Applied Mathematics of Computer
          Science, an experience leaving me captivated by computers, and the new
          mathematics we can discover to improve them.
