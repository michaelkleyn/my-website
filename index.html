      <h1>Hi, my name is Michael.</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a late entree to this side of internet culture, the one built by the
        coders and hackers. Previously I wanted to do music for all of my life,
        and that was my area of culture. I was deeply emeshed in the music
        industry and electronic music scene of california from 2010Â until about
        2017 when I decided it was time to explore another side to life. I
        started studying at a local community college part time, beginning with
        highschool math, until getting to where I am now having just recently
        graduated with a BS in Applied Mathematics. However, my educational
        journey is far from over as I continue to learn more about myself and
        how I move through the world.

        I currently live in San Francisco, and have just recently graduated from
        SFSU with a degree in Applied Mathematics of Computer Science (And yes,

          I am looking for work </a
        >ðŸ˜‰). I consider myself at the start of a life long career where I
        investigate different modalities of human-computer interactions. Whether
        this path takes me to exploring alien UI's or perhaps training ML models
        to perform specific tasks, I'm excited for the potential to stretch and
        expand the possibilities of humans as far as possible.
